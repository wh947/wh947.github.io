I'm a sophomore at Guangdong University of Foreign Studies with a focus in Finance. My educational journey, rooted in one of Chinaâ€™s vibrant economic centers, has ignited a strong passion for finance and a deep curiosity about global economic systems.

I'm very fortunate to be taught by [Prof Jennifer T. Lai](https://sites.google.com/site/tlaiecon/) from School of Finance, GDUFS.
